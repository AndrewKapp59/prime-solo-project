**A app to help organizations better promote thier artist recidency programs and make it easier for artist to find and apply to those programs**

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

Art Rez is an app that helps artists and organizations offering artist residencies find each other. The organizations are able to login to the app, make a profile and create posts detailing their the artist resideicny programs they are currently offering. Artists are then able to look through the login in, look through the posts and apply to their favorites. Ideally artists would also be able to do a filtered search of the programs. 
In case you're not familiar, artist residencies are programs that provide a space for artists to reflect, research, present and/or produce their art within another community. Residency can be organized by museums, universities, galleries, studio spaces, theaters, artist-run spaces, municipalities, governmental offices, and even festivals. They can be seasonal, ongoing, or tied to a particular one-time event. They can exist in urban spaces, rural villages, and deep in nature. 
The expectations and requirements also vary greatly as well. Sometimes resident artists are required to give presentations, workshops, or collaborate with local residents. At other times, they are secluded and given ample time to focus on and investigate their own practice.
